# mcp47x6

An Arduino library for the Microchip mcp4706, mcp4716 and mcp4726 8/10/12-bit DAC.

# Usage

Look into the sample sketch. It is easy.

# Hint

mcp4706, mcp4716 and mcp4726 use different methods for shifting out the bits. So in case your library uses one methode for all three chips changes are high that it only works for one type.
